These are the basics of web development. Open up the CSS, Javascript,
and HTML files in some kind of text editor to see my comments. To learn
more about web development and to look up specific functions/
CSS identifiers/HTML tags and attributes go to w3schools.com.

Also, if you want a good web dev tool, I would suggest installing
Netbeans. It's useful for managing web development and has support
for subversion/team development.
