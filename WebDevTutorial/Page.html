<!-- This specifies the type of web page. There's different standards like -->
<!-- xhtml (a cross between XML and HTML), HTML4, HTML5, etc... -->
<!-- This tells the web browser how to read and interpret what's in this file. -->

<html lang="en-US">

<!-- Start of the web page. 'lang="en-US"' is called an attribute. Attributes can be -->
<!-- added to any sort of tag. An HTML tag is written like this <tag> and with few -->
<!-- exceptions you almost always need a closing tag written as </tag> to end a section -->
<!-- lang="en-US" is merely telling the web browser to use the US English language char set. -->

   <head>
   <!-- The head section contains info about the web page like the title, search engine info, etc... -->

      <title>Cloud1</title>

      <!-- This is a style link. rel tells the browser what type and href tells the browser the location -->
      <!-- Right now we are pointing to the home directory (where the web page is located) you can -->
      <!-- tell the browser to look in a different location like this /folder/filename.ext -->
      <!-- everything is relative to the home directory. Anyways, this tells the browser to look -->
      <!-- for a file called styles.css in the home directory. That file contains all of our CSS. -->

      <!-- This is a script tag. Inside a script tag you can have your javascript functions. -->
      <!-- The src attribute is similar to href. This tag is empty, but it gives the location of -->
      <!-- a file that contains javascript functions. This particular tag points to the JQuery -->
      <!-- function library that google hosts for free. -->

      <!-- This tag links to our own file containing all of our javascript code. -->

      <!-- Note: the order of the tags is the order in which the web browser receives things. -->
      <!-- Generally, you want the CSS linking in the head tag because you want the CSS to be -->
      <!-- loaded before the browser tries to display the page so that everything is displayed correctly, -->
      <!-- but the script tags can actually go after the body. The reason for this is how pages are -->
      <!-- loaded. Depending on the size of the web page and connection speed the delay before a web page -->
      <!-- loads. If we place the javascript code up here the web page will completely load before -->
      <!-- being displayed, but it's going to be slower. If we place the javascript code at the end -->
      <!-- The page will be displayed faster, but any javascript will still need to be loaded. So, -->
      <!-- any javascript that alters the look of the page or performs some function won't occur immediately. -->

   </head>

   <body>
   <!-- The body tag encloses all the HTML structure of the page. This is the foundation for the -->
   <!-- page that will be modified by the CSS and javascript to give in the final coating of paint -->
   <!-- so to speak. -->

      <div class="header">
      <!-- The div tag is one of the most essential tags in HTML. It creates a division or block of -->
      <!-- elements. Basically, every individual section or object on the page should be in its own -->
      <!-- div tag. The class attribute is also very important. You can give any number of tags the -->
      <!-- same class and have as many classes as you want. This is useful for grouping items together. -->
      <!-- You can then use that class to target specific groups with your CSS and Javascript. -->
      <!-- By default a block style element. -->

         <img id="header-icon" src="./img/Cloud1.jpg" alt="Project Logo">
         <!-- HTML image tag. You can also add images through CSS. The src attribute is the location of -->
         <!-- the image. Also the id attribute functions almost identically to the class attribute, but -->
         <!-- each id name should only be given to one object so that it can be used to target that tag -->
         <!-- specifically with your CSS. -->

         <span id="header-text">Cloud1</span>

<!-- And that's the basics of the HTML file. Just one thing to note, while there are standards -->
<!-- for web development, every web browser has it's own way of interpreting and implementing -->
<!-- these standards. This means that all of your HTML, CSS, and Javascript will behave differently -->
<!-- in each browser/version of the browser. This poses the greatest challenge in web development. -->
<!-- You need to decide what browsers you will not support. For the most part, the latest versions -->
<!-- of IE, Firefox, and Chrome will behave similarly and based based on studies 90% of internet users -->
<!-- are going to be using these browsers. There's also Opera and Safari but they perform similarly. -->
<!-- That being said, I've had javascript functions that for some reason broke on the latest version -->
<!-- of Firefox but worked fine on Chrome. The real challenge comes from older versions of IE -->
<!-- and it's where IE gets it's reputation as the shittiest browser ever. Unfortunately, IE has its -->
<!-- Legacy BS so it has to have support for older stuff that causes lots of bugs. Any version pre-IE9 -->
<!-- will not work at all with any modern code, which is problematic because the newest version of IE -->
<!-- you can get on Windows XP is IE8. The only people using IE8 still are old people that know next -->
<!-- nothing about computers. With this in mind, most websites only support the newest version of IE -->
<!-- and modern browsers. You must always run your page in every web browser you support, because -->
<!-- you will need to make optimizations so everything looks and works as intended. -->
